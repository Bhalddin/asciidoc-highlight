== List example

Issue #1 https://github.com/edusantana/asciidoc-highlight/issues/1

* first item in list is highlighted just fine
* second item will break highlighting because that's an apostrophe I used right there
* this list item will not have highlighting
* neither will this one



I was writing most of my text in Portuguese, we do not use "'" so often as in English,
Now 'italic like this' won't work. You can use _italic like this_ instead.

This block still works.
